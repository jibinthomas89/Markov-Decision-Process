## Optimizing Customer Service Delivery for Lenovo Data Center Group

### __Summary__
The Lenovo Group is one of the largest technology companies in the world. For a technology company like Lenovo, early and efficient issue resolution plays a key role in reducing costs and driving customer satisfaction. Towards this end, in collaboration with Lenovo, a decision support system was proposed to help identify the appropriate service action to resolve an issue. The scope of the project was restricted to High Performance machines in the Asia Pacific and PRC regions. The methodology of this project involved accurately identifying key factors that exhibit similar issue resolution behaviors and ultimately translating these behaviors into a consistent prediction and action scheme through a Markov Decision Process
